# Inception Reporting Dashboard
This script will generate some plots for your INCEpTION project.
In it current state, it can be used by the project manager on site to visualize different metrics regarding the progress of the project, and the type of annotations done.
In case the project is part of a bigger project, the project progress can be exported to be sent to a project lead in a centralized location.

## Getting started
Generate some plots for tyour INCEpTION projects with the following steps:
- Clone this repo.
- Navigate into the repo.
- ``pip install .``
- Follow the instructions in ``inception_reports --help``
    - You will need to point to the direction with your exported INCEpTION project.
    - Next, choose which role you have in the project (go for manager if you don't know what that means.)
- tada!
