# Inception Reporting Dashboard
This script will generate some plots for your INCEpTION project based on the log data.
In it current state, it can be used by the project manager on site to visualize different metrics regarding the performance of the annotators and the progress of the project.
In case the project is part of a bigger project, the project progress can be exported to be sent to a project lead in a centralized location.

## Getting started
Generate some plots for the log data of your INCEpTION projects with the following steps:
- Clone this repo.
- Navigate into the repo.
- ``pip install -e .``
- Copy the exported log data (it's the "event.log" file or the exported zip file of your INCEpTION project.)
- Follow the instructions in ``inception_reports --help``
- tada!
